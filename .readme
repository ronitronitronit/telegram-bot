# i'm using "now" to run the bot. you can see the current deployment with the following command:
#
# now ls --all telegram-bot
#
# if i delete the old deployment (command: now rm [the url]) and add a new one (command: now), it works fine again.
# so i think there's something wrong with now, something about it being inactive for a period of time
#
# anyway, to set the webhook:
# curl -F "url=[the now url]/new-message"  https://api.telegram.org/bot540539721:AAHzt6XkCTLwwupyqWRjdhTRiMCSrK7YRNU/setWebhook
