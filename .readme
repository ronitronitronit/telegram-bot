i'm using "now" to run the bot. you can see the current deployment with the following command:

now ls --all telegram-bot

if i delete the old deployment (command: now rm [the url]) and add a new one (command: now), it works fine again.
so maybe this? maybe not? what do i know? https://zeit.co/docs/deployment-types/node#deployment-inactivity

anyway, to set the webhook:
curl -F "url=[the now url]/new-message"  https://api.telegram.org/bot540539721:AAHzt6XkCTLwwupyqWRjdhTRiMCSrK7YRNU/setWebhook
